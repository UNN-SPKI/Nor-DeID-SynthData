He has a primary diagnosis code I1311 - Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease without heart failure.\n\nIn the evaluation of vital signs, Mr. Hval (77 years old) presented with an elevated core temperature. Despite the feverish state, there were no signs of dehydration. The patient had reduced mobility, along with a slowed heart rate indicated by the cardiogram. During the physical examination, he reported feeling mild discomfort which was managed with analgesics. \n\nA further assessment showed a low blood pressure and slow breathing rate. This was carefully monitored and managed through a combination of medication and lifestyle recommendations. \n\nTreatment was mainly supportive, focusing on managing symptoms and improving his quality of life. Despite his underlying conditions, Mr. Hval responded well to treatment.\n\nDischarged Condition: \nUpon discharge, Mr. Hval's condition had significantly improved. He was recommended to continue with his medication schedule and advised on potential lifestyle modifications in response to his diagnosed conditions.\n\nRecommended Follow Up: \nMr. Hval is recommended to return for scheduled follow-up appointments with his primary care physician and specialists to manage his health conditions. \n\nSuccess to the interdisciplinary approach, Mr. Hval, despite his diagnosis, has shown promising improvement and resilience in his health. He is being discharged in good stable condition. His diligence and cooperation were noted and are bound to contribute significantly to his recovery journey.\n\nPrepared by:\n[Physician's Name]\n[Date]",
